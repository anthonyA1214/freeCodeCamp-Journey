                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="bold">Noli Me Tangere</span> (1887) ‚Äì exposed the corruption and abuse of Spanish friars and officials.

                            <span class="bold">El Filibusterismo</span> (1891) ‚Äì a darker sequel that pushed for reform and social justice.
                        </li>

                       Though he had no direct involvement in the armed revolution, Rizal was accused of 
                       inspiring it through his writings. He was arrested, tried, and convicted of 
                       rebellion. On the morning of <span class="bold">December 30, 1896</span>, at
